# booth-node-defender-client

Protect your node client for as long as possible. Defend against waves of murderous server side code that wants nothing more than to kill and disconnect your node client.

## Playing the game

To defend your node, you will need to implement a strategy against the waves of enemies that will attack you. A sample strategy has been provided to make you familiar with the available API to the server.

To begin, edit `strategy.js` in the root folder and devise your strategy to last as long as possible against the onslaught.

## Running the game

* Install dependencies

```npm install```

* Define the host and run npm start as follows:

```HOST=<server host> npm start```

By default, `HOST` is `localhost:1337`.
